# Iris-Flower-Classification
Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning problem that involves classifying iris flowers into one of three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their physical characteristics. The dataset contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms for supervised classification problems.

This project is ideal for beginners to learn and understand the complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation.

Features
The Iris Flower Classification system includes the following functionalities:

Data Preprocessing:

Load and clean the dataset.
Handle missing or incorrect values (if any).
Normalize or scale features to improve model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the distribution of features.
Visualize relationships between features and the target species.
Generate pair plots and correlation matrices.
Model Training:

Train classification models such as:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forests
Fine-tune models using hyperparameter optimization techniques.
Model Evaluation:

Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
Perform cross-validation to ensure robustness.
Prediction:

Predict the species of an iris flower given its features.
Provide a user-friendly interface for input and output.
Dataset
The project uses the classic Iris Dataset introduced by Ronald A. Fisher. It is available in the sklearn library and on platforms like Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository.
